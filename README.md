# What is this repository for? #
This repository is for creating fast access data structures for C# in Unity and other general applications.

# Why create this? #
Well, typically the standard .NET or Mono data structures are fine, but in the context of game development, I 
want to aim for fast data structures which do not typically generate garbage on runtime and can be value based 
instead of reference based.

Use of **unsafe** keyword may be used for manual memory management.

This is ***highly*** experimental and ***really*** considered me reinventing the wheel - which may not be considered a good 
thing for most devs.

Updates may not be regular and is highly dependent/influenced by a private project I'm working on.
