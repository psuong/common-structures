# Common Structures #

Common Structures redefines a few C# standard library data structures. I'll be tackling basic ones initially and work 
up towards complex data structures.

The purpose of these data structures is to be compatable with Unity's Entity Component System workflow, but can also be
used as a general purpose data structure in regular C# applications.
